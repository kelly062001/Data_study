Seo Gong Myung is guided by his moral convictions, which he staunchly adheres to, opting to do everything ‘by the book’.  His lack of flexibility and his penchant for criticizing all those who enter his domain not only serve to earn him the nickname ‘Great Lucifer’, but more enemies than friends.Goo Se Ra is a lower-class woman with little education or money, but she can still talk a good game and punch well above her own weight.  Known as the ‘Queen of Civil Complaints’, she’s a force to be reckoned with! She’s held many positions in the past, none of which have materialized into a stable source of income. Small wonder the opening of the District People's Council, with an annual salary of 50 million won for a mere 90 working days, could be just the ticket she needs to better her circumstances. The sparks start flying as the newly-demoted Seo Gong Myung and newbie Council member Goo Se Ra join forces to penalize corrupt politicians.
